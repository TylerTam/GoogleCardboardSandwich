IDEAS:
Obviously make the sandwich.
	-When the player taps on a material, snap it to a transform on thei hand
	-If they are holding something, and a new material is tapped on, drop that something
	-If they tap on the sandwich, add the material to the sandwich
	-Tapping on the stick finishes the sandwich
	-After something is dropped, have it shrink and despawn if not picked up within 10 seconds

Yeet the food
	-Use raycast and shooter aim assist
	-Basically a way to get the raycast in there, cause im not sure if the raycast that comes with the asset pack counts

Have a dog?
	-Sits beside you
	-When you pick up meat, it will start begging
	
	-If the dog is fed, have it walk off screen with the meat in its mouth


TODO:
-Fix player collider so that it will adjust with how big the sandwich is
-Add fridge model
-Do smething with peanut butter and knife or some shit
